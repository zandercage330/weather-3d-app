# Rules for vibe coding

## Code structure & organization

- **Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
  - Extract repeated logic into reusable functions
  - Create utility functions for common operations (validation, formatting, etc.)
  - Use shared components for UI patterns that appear multiple times

- **Break down large files**
  - Split files larger than 300-400 lines into smaller modules
  - Separate concerns: data fetching, business logic, UI rendering
  - Create focused components that do one thing well

- **Use logical file organization**
  - Group related files by feature or domain
  - Create separate directories for components, utilities, services, etc.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions across the project

## Security practices

- **Input validation and sanitization**
  - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
  - Use parameterized queries for database operations
  - Sanitize any data before rendering it to prevent XSS attacks

- **Authentication & authorization**
  - Protect sensitive routes with authentication middleware
  - Implement proper authorization checks for data access
  - Use role-based permissions for different user types

- **API security**
  - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
  - Set secure HTTP headers (CORS, Content-Security-Policy)
  - Use HTTPS for all connections

- **Secrets management**
  - Never hardcode secrets or credentials in source code
  - Store sensitive values in environment variables
  - Use secret management services for production environments

## Error handling

- **Implement comprehensive error handling**
  - Catch and handle specific error types differently
  - Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
  - Present user-friendly error messages in the UI

- **Handle async operations properly**
  - Use try/catch blocks with async/await
  - Handle network failures gracefully
  - Implement loading states for better user experience

## Performance optimization

- **Minimize expensive operations**
  - Cache results of costly calculations
  - Use memoization for pure functions
  - Implement pagination for large data sets

- **Prevent memory leaks**
  - Clean up event listeners and subscriptions
  - Cancel pending requests when components unmount
  - Clear intervals and timeouts when no longer needed

- **Optimize rendering**
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Use virtualization for long lists
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading

## Database best practices

- **Use transactions for related operations**
  - Wrap related database operations in transactions
  - Ensure data consistency across multiple operations
  - Implement proper rollback mechanisms

- **Optimize queries**
  - Create indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Select only the fields you need
  - Use query pagination when fetching large datasets

- **Handle database connections properly**
  - Use connection pools
  - Close connections when operations complete
  - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

## API design

- **Follow RESTful principles**
  - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Return consistent response formats
  - Use meaningful HTTP status codes

- **Design clear endpoints**
  - Organize endpoints by resource
  - Version your API
  - Document all endpoints with examples

- **Implement proper error responses**
  - Return structured error objects
  - Include error codes and helpful messages
  - Maintain detailed logs of API errors

## Maintainability

- **Use clear naming**
  - Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names
  - Avoid abbreviations and cryptic naming
  - Use consistent naming patterns throughout the codebase

- **Add documentation**
  - Document complex functions with clear descriptions
  - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
  - Keep documentation up-to-date when code changes

- **Write tests**
  - Cover critical business logic with unit tests
  - Write integration tests for important flows
  - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Frontend specific

- **Implement form validation**
  - Validate input as users type
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Handle form submission errors gracefully

- **Use proper state management**
  - Choose appropriate state management for your app's complexity
  - Avoid prop drilling through many component levels
  - Keep state as close as possible to where it's needed

- **Ensure accessibility**
  - Use semantic HTML elements
  - Add proper ARIA attributes for complex elements
  - Ensure keyboard navigability
  - Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Security vulnerabilities to prevent

- **SQL/NoSQL injection**
  - Never concatenate user input directly into queries
  - Use parameterized queries or ORM methods

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**
  - Sanitize user input before displaying it
  - Use frameworks' built-in protection mechanisms

- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**
  - Implement anti-CSRF tokens
  - Validate request origins

- **Broken authentication**
  - Implement proper session management
  - Use secure password hashing
  - Enforce strong password policies
