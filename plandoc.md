- Serverless functions - For cost-effective scaling

### Weather Data Sources
- **OpenWeatherMap API** - Comprehensive weather data including current conditions and forecasts
- **WeatherAPI** - Robust API with good free tier options
- **Tomorrow.io** - Advanced hyperlocal weather data
- **National Weather Service API** - Free US weather data (no API key required)
- **Weatherbit** - Global weather data with good documentation

### Additional Technologies
- **Redux/Context API** - State management
- **Axios/Fetch** - API requests
- **React Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **Styled Components/Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Jest/React Testing Library** - Testing
- **GitHub Actions/CircleCI** - CI/CD

## 3. Architecture Design

### Application Structure
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Clean separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data fetching)
- Responsive design for various device sizes

### Data Flow
```
User → UI Components → State Management → API Services → Weather API → 
API Services → State Management → UI Components → User
```

### Storage Strategy
- Cache weather data for offline access
- Store user preferences and settings locally
- Use server caching to reduce API calls

## 4. UI/UX Design

### Design Principles
- Clean, intuitive interface with visual weather representations
- High contrast for outdoor visibility
- Accessible design for all users

### Key Screens
1. **Main Screen**: Current conditions and summary forecast
2. **Detailed Forecast**: Extended daily and hourly information
3. **Location Management**: Search and saved locations
4. **Settings**: User preferences and notification settings
5. **Weather Maps**: Interactive weather visualizations

### Design Process
1. Create wireframes for all screens
2. Develop high-fidelity mockups
3. Build interactive prototypes for user testing
4. Refine designs based on feedback

- Performance under various network conditions
- Device compatibility

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### App Store Submission
1. Prepare app store listings and screenshots
2. Create compelling app descriptions
3. Set up privacy policy and terms of service
4. Configure app store analytics

### Continuous Integration/Deployment
1. Set up automated build process
2. Implement testing in CI pipeline
3. Configure staged deployments (beta → production)
4. Plan for app updates and maintenance

## 9. Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
